This is the home page for the Stardust Science project, an asynchronous rendering research project. This project is a joint effort among **Los Alamos National Laboratory**, **The University of Texas at Austin** and **The University of New Hampshire**. The team includes:

- James Ahrens (PI), Los Alamos National Laboratory
- David H. Rogers, Los Alamos National Laboratory
- Colin Ware, University of New Hampshire 
- Francesca Samsel, University of Texas at Austin (TACC) 
- Greg Abram, University of Texas at Austin (TACC) 
- Paul Navratil, University of Texas at Austin (TACC) 
- Stephanie Zellar, University of Texas at Austin (TACC) 

The Stardust project has resulted in a range of publications, open source software capabilities, and web content that embodies the novel research done by the team. These include:

- The [**Final Report**](/assets/2020_Final_Report.pdf)

- **Galaxy** engine, a platform to explore asynchronous rendering and sampling algorithms. Galaxy can be downloaded from the [Stardust Science github](http://www.github.com/stardustscience).

- **Andromeda** prototype, a platform to explore a streaming approach to rendering and sampling massive data. Andromeda will be made available at the [Stardust Science github](http://www.github.com/stardustscience).

- [**SciVisColor.org**](http://www.sciviscolor.org), a website that organizes work about approaches to coloring scientific datasets.

- Stardust publications are listed [here](publications).
